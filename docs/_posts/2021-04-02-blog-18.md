<h1>VPC Private and Public Subnet</h1>

In this blog post, I will demonstrate step by step how to achieve creating the following
(A) Create a VPC
(B) Private Subnet and Public Subnet
(C) Two EC2 Instances (one with each subnet attached)
(D) SSH into the Public EC2 instance
(E) SSH into the Private EC2 instance via the Public EC2
(F) Add NAT Gateway

<h3>Create a VPC With Public and Private Subnets</h3>
1. Go to the AWS Console and create a VPC with the CIDR 10.200.0.0/16
2. Attach Internet Gateway
3. Make public-subnet with IPV4 CIDR of 10.200.0.0/24
4. Create a route table public-subnet-route-table
5. Once created selected the route table and go to routes and route to the Internet Gateway at the address of 0.0.0.0/0
6. Go to the subnet associations tab and add the public subnet 
7. Make private-subnet-1 and private subnet-2 with IPV4 CIDR of 10.200.0.0/24
8. Go to the subnet associations tab and add the private subnet 
9. Setup an EC2 instance and select the default VPC and attach to it the public subnet and enable auto assign IP
10. Add tag Name PublicEC2
11. On step 6 configure security group PublicEC2-SG
12. Download key pair PublicEC2.pem
13. Setup an EC2 instance and select the default VPC and attach to it the private subnet and doable auto assign IP
14. Add tag Name PrivateEC2
15. On step 6 configure security group PrivateEC2-SG with SSH TCP Port 22 10.200.0.0/24 and All ICMP IPV4 ICMP Port 0-65535 10.200.0.0/24
16. Download key pair PrivateEC2.pem
17. Go to the public EC2 and click connect to instance
18. cd to Downloads first  and then follow the instruction provided when you click the connect tab in the console to connect to the public EC2 via terminal 
19. Ping the private IP of the private EC2 it should work
20. Try to run the command ssh ec2-user@10.200.1.215 it will not work
21. Run command openssl rsa -in PrivateEC2.pem -text to get the contents of PrivateEC2.pem. Copy the RSA key
22. Create a new file called nano connect.pem and paste the RSAkey there
23. Run the command chmod 400 connect.pem to allow SSH to work
24. Then connect to the private ec2 using the new connect.pem file $ ssh -i connect.pem ec2-user@10.200.1.4
25. ping google.com it will not work as it has no access to the internet we need the NAT Gateway to do so

<h3>NAT Gateway</h3>
1. We will create a NAT Gateway so that the EC2 instance with the private subnet can access the internet
2. Go to VPC and click NAT Gateway and create NAT Gateway
3. For subnet, select the public subnet we create and select allocate elastic IP to populate the elastic IP allocation ID
4. Go to Route Tables and select the private route table and click on the routes tab
5. Click edit route and add access to the internet using the destination of 0.0.0.0/0 and the target being the NAT we just set up
6. Go back and if not done already in terminal cd Downloads and SSH into the public EC2 and then SSH into the private instance
7. Ping google.com if it works it means we can connect to the internet
