Hi there welcome back to my weekly blog series for CIT 480. This week I wanted to take some time to discuss HTML and some commonly used tags. I am working on creating a website for my work and have noticed many tags appear in my code and decided it would make for a great blog post. Of course, I am not going to discuss all the wonderful tags available but will go over the ones I see often and think are important to discuss. Note when using tags most of them will need a closing. For example if I am using the tag to make a paragraph, I must have the `<p>` in the beginning of the paragraph and when I want to end my paragraph I must use the backslash to denote that like this `</p>`. Also note that many of the HTML tags can be styled using CSS such as the font sizes of the `<h1>` tags which we will get to in detail in another blog post!

`<!— —>` This is not really a tag that has use on the visuals of your webpage but is important as this is how you can comment in your code. Documentation in code is very important especially if you are working with other!
`<main` This tag is used to refer to the main content of the website 
`<div>` This tag when used refers to a certain section of code and can be very useful if you are applying certain styles to one block of code but do not want to apply it to the whole page.
`<h1> - <h6>` This tag is used to make heading on the website. Headings can come in a variety of sizes ranging from 1-6. 
`<p>` This is the paragraph tag and is used to make paragraphs on the website
`<img src=“url”>` The img tag is used to place images on the site. You can add in features to define the width and height of the image 
`<strong>` This tag is used to make the text appear visually bold and semantically 
`<bold>` This tag almost similar to strong is used to make the text appear visually bold 
`<ol>` This is used to make an ordered list which means each list item will have a number next to it
`<ul>` This is used to make an unordered list which means each list item will have a bullet point next to them
`<li>` This tag is used to denote an item in the list and can be used in both the ordered list and unordered list. 
`<br>` This tag is used to make a line break

I hope these tags and their descriptions will be useful for you as you create your webpage.
