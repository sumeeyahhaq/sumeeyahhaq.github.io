Hi there! Welcome back to my CIT 480 weekly blog series. This week I wokred on a lab for this class which went over the basics of Docker. I have used Docker in the past but really needed to refresh my memry on a few concepts I had learned so I thought I'd dedicate this blog post to go over some basic docker command with you all and explain what they do. Follow along with this post if you'd like to know more about Docker and some easy commands to use.
