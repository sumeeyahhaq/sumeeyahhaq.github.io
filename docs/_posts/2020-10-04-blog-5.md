This blog will focus on creating a Dockerfile. This weeks blog post will talk about what a Dockerfile is and walk you through some of the commands that can be used in a Dockerfile.

Before I go into what each command means, I first want to talk about what a Dockerfile is. A`Dockerfile` is a file that contains a list of commands that are executed using the command `docker build -t <image name here> . ` command. This is much easier than executing each command one at a time as I had done in Lab 1 which was where we had to install and configure a LAMP stack one command at a time. Lab 2 had us create a Dockerfile with a set of commands to do it for us which is in my opinion a big shortcut and time saver especially if you have to continuously run the set of command. 

So when creating a Dockerfile, first make a directory you want to run the file in. I made a new directory called cit480 (name it anything) using the command `mkdir cit480`. Then I used `cd cit480` to go into the directory where I ran the command `nano Dockerfile` to create the Dockerfile I would begin typing command in. Below are a few commands I used in my Dockerfile I am sure there are more.

`FROM`: This command is the first part of your Dockerfile and contains the image that you will be using. For me I used the ubuntu:18.04 image so my FROM command on the first line of the file stated `FROM ubuntu:18.04`

`WORKDIR`: When using a text editor in your Dockerfile it is best to use the WORKDIR command instead of the RUN command. Use this for example `WORKDIR /var/www/html`

`ENV`: This command can be used for when you want to use an enviormnent variable in the Dockerfile. I had come across it when I had come to a step in the Dockerfile execution that asked for user input. In Dockerfile execution you cannot give input so I used the command `ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive` which ignores any user input and moves forward with the Dockerfile execution. 

`RUN`: This command will more likely and can be used multiple times in your Dockerfile as its purpose is to run commands inside the Dockerfile. You will see how CMD and RUN are often mixed up but completely different. 

`CMD`: You should only have one CMD in your Dockerfile as the last CMD is used and other CMD commands in your Dockerfile are ignored. The purpose of the CMD command is to run that line when the Docker container runs.
